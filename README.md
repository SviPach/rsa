# RSA Encryption

## Description

**RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that enables secure data transmission. It utilizes a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

This project is a Windows Forms application developed in C# that demonstrates the RSA encryption and decryption process, including key generation, encryption, and decryption functionalities.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generate public and private keys for encryption and decryption.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt plaintext messages using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt ciphertext messages using the private key.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: User-friendly interface built with Windows Forms for ease of use.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that inputs are valid and formatted correctly before processing.
